High-order, non-linear, 2D cantilever FEM simulation
====================================================

Using the Finite Element Method (FEM) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) I simulate a 2D cantilever using a non-linear FEM with n-degree (higher order) triangular elements.
I use a Neo-Hookean solid (hyperelastic) model. Includes simple rendering in matplotlib as well as generating gifs of the resulting simulation. Also shows the various energy curves throughout the simulation.
